// A slim, always-visible bar shown whenever the Google connection has lapsed
// (needsReauth) — persistent across every screen, unlike a toast, which only
// helps if you happen to be looking at the exact moment it fires. That's the
// scenario this exists for: you closed the tab or left it idle long enough
// for the token to expire, come back later, and start typing before ever
// noticing "tap to reconnect" quietly changed in a corner. Local edits are
// always safe (IndexedDB never depends on this), but they won't reach the
// Sheet until reconnected, so this stays up until that happens instead of
// auto-dismissing.
